[29.59 - 33.33]Speaker A: I'm sorry, I was looking for Mrs. Doyle.
[33.67 - 35.65]Speaker B: It is Mrs. Doyle.
[36.39 - 47.33]Speaker A: What? I thought you were Marilyn Monroe now? Couple of nice pints for you.
[47.40 - 50.09]Speaker B: Oh, great. We're a bit low, actually.
[55.91 - 65.40]Speaker A: There's plenty more where that came from. I tell you, I shouldn't be here at all. The police are after me.
[65.51 - 66.39]Speaker B: They're not.
[66.48 - 78.20]Speaker A: Yes. I'm so gorgeous, they want to put me under arrest. Actually, I'm a bit sad at the moment, Mrs. Doyle.
[78.35 - 78.67]Speaker C: Yes?
[78.70 - 79.90]Speaker A: I have to go to a funeral.
[79.99 - 81.75]Speaker B: Oh, no. Really?
[81.84 - 86.83]Speaker A: Yes. My last girlfriend, she died from exhaustion.
[94.03 - 94.81]Speaker D: Hello.
[96.91 - 101.85]Speaker B: Hello, Father. This is Pat Mustard, the new milkman.
[102.83 - 103.77]Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
[103.80 - 108.29]Speaker A: Just here over the south side of the island. Thought I'd spread myself around a bit.
[108.83 - 114.13]Speaker D: Mrs. Doyle, you need to do some dusting up in Father Jack's room. And there's a huge cobweb in the shed needs removing.
[114.26 - 114.84]Speaker A: All right.
[114.89 - 116.09]Speaker B: Also, Father.
[120.35 - 126.26]Speaker A: Well, I'll be on my way, Padre. Off on my rounds.
[132.52 - 146.02]Speaker C: Right, Ted. Looks like an ordinary blackboard, doesn't it? Yes, that's what I thought. But watch this. You see, you can rub off the letters.
[149.24 - 151.62]Speaker D: You can do that with every blackboard. Dougal.
[152.39 - 153.13]Speaker C: What?
[159.59 - 170.70]Speaker D: This is a very milky cup of tea, Mrs. Doyle. This is almost an all milk cup of tea. I mean, is there any tea in here at all?
[170.89 - 172.65]Speaker B: Well, no.
[174.71 - 181.85]Speaker D: Anyone would think you were trying to use up all the milk so that. So that Pat Mustard can come here more often.
[184.84 - 197.78]Speaker B: That's very interesting, though, Father. At the weekends, he's a swimming instructor in the pool. And he fought in Vietnam. And He's a former Mr. Universe. And he taught Elvis Presley how to play karate.
[199.16 - 203.84]Speaker D: It sounds to me as though he's telling you a few tall tales. What do you think, Dougal?
[203.92 - 206.38]Speaker C: Well, Ted, I'm very cynical, as you know.
[212.33 - 219.11]Speaker B: Well, Father, it's not my place, I know, but it sounds to me like you're a little bit jealous.
[221.37 - 222.15]Speaker A: Jealous?
[222.26 - 232.87]Speaker D: Of Mr. Milky Man? I very much think not. What are you doing, Dougal?
[232.98 - 238.25]Speaker C: I was just looking at some of the hairy babies from today. There's something about them.
[238.44 - 239.49]Speaker D: Let's see.
[244.59 - 246.21]Speaker A: Oh, my God. What?
[246.51 - 257.45]Speaker D: This is a terrible thing to say, but if you took this baby's mustache, this baby's head hair and this baby's sideboards and put them together, I think you'd get Pat Mustard.
[260.59 - 262.97]Speaker C: Do you think the babies are copying in style?
[265.79 - 276.33]Speaker D: No, Dougal, I think it's more likely that. That. That Pat Mustard has been. You know, I mean, delivering more than dairy products.
[277.99 - 280.81]Speaker A: No, you mean he's been.
[280.98 - 281.69]Speaker D: Who?
[281.86 - 284.37]Speaker C: I can't Ho, ho.
[285.03 - 286.73]Speaker D: He. No, wait. What?
[289.11 - 290.41]Speaker C: He's been what?
[293.91 - 298.97]Speaker D: I think we should do a little detective work. Find out what this Pat Mustard fellow's up to.
[309.93 - 316.39]Speaker B: Hello, Father. Oh, Pat was wondering if he could put his massive tool in my box.
[317.85 - 319.17]Speaker D: What? How dare you.
[319.21 - 325.67]Speaker A: Yes, too big for the milk float. I'll pick it up tomorrow.
[326.59 - 328.90]Speaker D: Mrs. Doyle, could you leave us for a few moments?
[329.05 - 330.41]Speaker B: I shall, Father.
[335.63 - 343.40]Speaker D: I know what's going on, Pat Mustard. There are some very hairy babies on Craggy island. And I think. You and the hairy baby maker. No. Yet.
[343.53 - 352.43]Speaker A: Well, I think that you would need proof if you're going to make that sort of an accusation. And I'm a very careful man, Father. A very careful man.
[352.61 - 354.83]Speaker D: Except when it comes to taking precautions in the bedroom.
[354.90 - 360.22]Speaker A: Now, you wouldn't be advising the use of artificial contraception now, Father, would you?
[361.08 - 370.54]Speaker D: Yes, I. No, I. If you're going to be. I. Of course, you just feck off.
